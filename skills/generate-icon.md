# Uprate Icon Generator

Generate a production-ready app icon using AI, based on your project's context.

## Instructions

Follow these steps exactly in order. Use AskUserQuestion for all user choices.

### Step 1: Analyze the Codebase

Spawn the `uprate-codebase-analyzer` agent to analyze the current project:

```
Use the Agent tool with subagent_type "general-purpose" and name "uprate-codebase-analyzer":
Prompt: Read the agent file at ~/.claude/agents/uprate-codebase-analyzer.md and follow its instructions exactly to analyze this project.
```

Parse the JSON output from the agent. If any fields are `null`, ask the user to provide them.

Present the findings to the user:

```
I analyzed your project and found:
- **App:** {appName}
- **Description:** {description}
- **Colors:** {colors as hex swatches}
- **Platform:** {platform}

Does this look right?
```

Use AskUserQuestion with options: "Looks correct" and "I want to adjust" (with Other option for custom input).

### Step 2: Prefetch Styles, Ideas, and Auth Token

Spawn a general-purpose subagent with this exact prompt (substituting `<app_description>` with the actual description):

```
Do the following tasks and return ALL results as a single JSON object. Do not stop early.

1. Read auth config:
   cat ~/.uprate/config.json 2>/dev/null || echo "{}"

2. If neither "apiKey" nor "guestToken" exists in the config, create a guest session:
   curl -s -X POST https://app.upratehq.com/api/cli/session \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/json"
   Save the token: mkdir -p ~/.uprate && echo '{"guestToken":"<token>"}' > ~/.uprate/config.json

3. Fetch styles:
   curl -s https://app.upratehq.com/api/cli/styles

4. Fetch ideas (use the actual app description):
   curl -s -X POST https://app.upratehq.com/api/cli/generate/ideas \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"description": "<app_description>"}'

Return this JSON (fill in real values):
{
  "token": "<apiKey or guestToken value>",
  "styles": [<styles array from API, or [] on failure>],
  "ideas": [<ideas array from API, or [] on failure>]
}
```

Parse the subagent's JSON output to get `token`, `styles`, and `ideas`.

- If `styles` is empty, load styles from the `uprate:references:icon-styles` skill as fallback.
- If `ideas` is empty, ask the user to describe what they want the icon to look like.

Present styles to the user via AskUserQuestion. Each style should be an option with its name as the label and a short description.

Present ideas to the user via AskUserQuestion with each idea as an option. The user can also write their own via the "Other" option.

### Step 3: Generate the Icon

Spawn a general-purpose subagent with this exact prompt (substituting all `<placeholders>` with real values):

```
Submit this icon generation request and return the full JSON response body:

curl -s -X POST https://app.upratehq.com/api/cli/generate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  -d '{
    "app_description": "<app_description>",
    "icon_description": "<chosen_idea>",
    "style_id": "<style_uuid>",
    "colors": [<hex_colors_as_quoted_strings>]
  }'

Return the full JSON response exactly as received.
```

Parse the subagent's response:
- If HTTP 401: tell the user their API key is invalid and ask them to create a new one at https://app.upratehq.com/settings
- If HTTP 429: tell the user they've reached their monthly limit and suggest upgrading at https://app.upratehq.com/settings/billing

### Step 4: Show the Result

Parse the response for `request_id` (UUID), and also read `view_url` if the API already returns it.

Build the final preview link like this:

1. If `view_url` exists in the response, use it.
2. If `view_url` is missing but `request_id` exists, build: `https://app.upratehq.com/icons/new/{request_id}`.
3. If neither exists, show an error and ask the user to retry generation.

Show the user:

```
Your icon is generating! It should be ready in about 30 seconds.

Preview it here: {preview_url}

You can preview without an account.

```

Done! Do not proceed with any additional steps unless the user asks.
